#####A band website with fully functional store and blog.

View it here: http://sisterssite-env.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com 

Installation: use "git clone" to copy to your computer and then open in your preferred browser.

Technologies used: AngularJS, Express, Node.js, Firebase, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, [ngCart](https://github.com/snapjay/ngCart), and [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).

Room for improvement: 
* desktop version (which will mostly be used by tour managers for data entry)
* allowing users to connect to see when friends are playing in the same place
